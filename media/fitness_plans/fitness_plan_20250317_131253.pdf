**Note:** This is a sample plan.  The provided meal plan is a suggestion and calorie and macro needs will vary based on individual metabolic rate and activity level.  It's crucial to consult a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized dietary advice.  Progressive overload (gradually increasing the intensity of workouts) is key for continued progress.  Listen to your body and rest when needed.  This plan assumes a baseline intermediate fitness level; adjust accordingly if needed.  Always prioritize proper form to avoid injuries.
