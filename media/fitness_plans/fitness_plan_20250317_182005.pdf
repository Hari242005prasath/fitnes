<!-- Repeat similar tables for Week 2 and Week 3, gradually increasing reps, sets, or duration.  Adjust the meal plan as needed to maintain variety and meet protein goals. -->



```

**Note:**  This is a sample plan.  It's crucial for the 56-year-old male to consult with a doctor or physical therapist before starting any new exercise program.  The meal plan is a suggestion and should be adjusted based on individual caloric needs and preferences.  The protein goals are estimates and can be adjusted based on individual needs.  Progressive overload (gradually increasing the intensity of workouts over time) is key to seeing results.  Weeks 2 and 3 would involve increasing reps, sets, or duration of exercises.  Consider adding other vegetarian protein sources like paneer or tempeh. Remember that consistency and a balanced diet are essential for weight loss.
